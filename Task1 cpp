# CodeAlpha_Project_Name Task 1 

*** I developed a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it, with hints guide the player.
             This project was a fantastic way to deepen my understanding of C++ and enhance my problem-solving skills.***

 My first task is   "Develop a number guessing game where the
                    computer randomly selects a number, and the
                    player has to guess it. Provide hints like "too high"
                    or "too low" to help the player guess the correct
                    number".

          Welcome to my Number Guessing Game project! This simple console-based game is developed in C++ as part of my internship at Code Alpha.
          The game involves the computer randomly selecting a number between 1 and 10, and the player must guess the number.
          The game provides hints like "too high" or "too low" to help the player guess the correct number.

Features of code:-
        Random Number Generation:-  The game uses a random number generator to select a number between 1 and 10.
        User Input:-  Players can enter their guesses via the console.
        Hint System:-  The game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
        Winning Condition:-  The game congratulates the player when the correct number is guessed.
